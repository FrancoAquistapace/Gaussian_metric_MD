# Gaussian Similarity Metric for Atomic Configurations in Molecular Dynamics

In this repository, I develop a metric that can measure the similarity between two atomic configurations. To do this, I define a measure representation of each configuration by means of Gaussian density functions, and an inner product that is used to then measure the similarity of these representations.
