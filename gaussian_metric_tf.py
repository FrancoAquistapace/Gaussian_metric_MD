# Define function to get cubic domain that contains
# two configurations
def get_cubic_domain(C1, C2, step_size, margin_size):
    '''
    Params:
        C1, C2 : tf.Tensor
            Arrays containing atomic configurations
            C1 and C2, respectively.
        step_size : int or float
            Size in A of the side of a cubic volume, which
            is used to discretise the cubic domain.
        margin_size : int or float
            Size in A of the margins added in each direction
            to the cubic integration domain.
        
    Output:
        Returns a cubic space that contains both C1 and C2, 
        discretised as cubes of side step_size and represented
        by their center vector. This space is extended in each 
        dimension an amount 2 * margin_size.

    # Determine max and min values of the cubic domain

# Define multivariate Gaussian function
def multi_Gaussian(X, X_0, sigma):
    '''
    Params:
        X : tf.Tensor
            One-dimensional array of length 3, where each
            element represents the x, y and z component of a 
            position vector, respectively. This array acts as
            the variable of the function.
        X_0 : tf.Tensor
            One-dimensional array of length 3, where each
            element represents the x, y and z component of a 
            position vector, respectively. This array acts as
            the mean if the Gaussian density function.
        sigma : float or int
            Value for the standard deviation of the Gaussian
            density function.

    Output:
        Returns the value of f(X) at the given point X. The 
        function f(X) is a multivariate Gaussian density, 
        defined as:
            f(X) = sqrt(2*pi*sigma)^(-3) * exp(-|X-X_0|^2/(2*sigma))
    '''

# Define measure representation of a configuration C from 
# different sources
def measure_representation(X, C, scale=1):
    '''
    Params:
        X : tf.Tensor
            One-dimensional array of length 3, where each
            element represents the x, y and z component of a 
            position vector, respectively. This array acts as
            the variable of the function.
        C : tf.Tensor
            Array containing atomic positions in 3 dimensions.
            In every case, C must be of shape (N, 3), where N 
            is the number of atoms in the configuration.
        scale : float or int (optional)
            Value used to transform each position vector X as:
                X -> scale * X
            Default value is 1.

    Output:
        Returns the value of the measure representation at the 
        given point X. The measure representation C_r is built as:
            C_r(X) = (1 / sqrt(|C|)) * sum_X_0(f(X,X_0))
        Where |C| is the amount of atoms in C, sum_X_0 is a sum over 
        all of the positions X_0 contained in C, and f(X,X_0) is 
        defined as:
            f(X, X_0) = multi_Gaussian(X, X_0, sigma=(4 * pi)^(-1))
        This is a multivariate Gaussian density function with 
        standard deviation std=(4 * pi)^(-1) and mean X_0.
